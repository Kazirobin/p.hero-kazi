    <b>This is bold teg for writeing bold type text</b>
    Although the boundaries of East Bengal were based ostensibly on religion, they did not entirely reflect it. Owing to disagreements between the Hindu and Muslim contingents of the commission tasked with delimiting the province, <b>the frontiers were ultimately</b> determined by the head of the commission, Sir Cyril Radcliffe. 
    The difference between the two tags is that the bold tag <strong>is intended to draw attention to the text,</strong> while the strong tag also highlights the text semantically and indicates that this is an important word or section of text.
